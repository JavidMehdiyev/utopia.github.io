            <p style="line-height: 2;">Hour Of Code - was a second homework , which actually was one of the most difficult tasks. Students were divided into the groups of 3-5 people. The main goal of the
homework was to find the school, prepare the presentation about the basics of programming, and to explain what is programming to the pupils of the school.
Additionally, we presented a presentation about ADA University, where we encouraged pupils showing the quality of education and positive feedback of students about university.
Our team negotiated with school â„–145 to provide a full lesson, to introduce our two presentations and explain the programming basics using the Code.org website,where
we showed how to write the code by combining interesting information, and practice which actually was just the puzzles. For solution of each puzzle pupils needed to
write a code, that would fit the solution.
The project was very unusual and interesting both for team members and school pupils.
